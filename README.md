# Preset Embedded SDK

The Preset Embedded SDK allows you to embed dashboards from your Workspaces into your own app, via an ``iframe``. Refer to [our documentation](https://docs.preset.io/docs/dashboard-embedding) for instructions. You can also use [our sample app](https://github.com/preset-io/embedded-example) for testing.
