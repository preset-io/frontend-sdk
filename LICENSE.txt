Version Date: August 23, 2024

Welcome to Preset, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal offices at 107 S. B St., 2nd Floor, San Mateo, CA 94401, USA [“Preset” “we” “us” “our”]. We are pleased to offer you [“Customer” (or Customer’s agent or employee), “you” “your”] a license to our online Software Development Kit initially consisting of our website dashboard widget and any related online documentation [“SDK”], provided at no cost to you, to enable you to install and enable Preset’s state-of-the-art embedded Superset dashboard [“Dashboard”], which will help you optimize and enhance your personal or organization’s/company’s website.

If you download and use the SDK, you expressly acknowledge that you and the organization you represent are a party to this Website Dashboard SDK License Agreement [“Agreement”], understand it and agree to be bound by it as of the date you download the SDK [“Effective Date”]. You will only need one (1) license from Preset per SDK per website. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an organization or company, you hereby affirm that you are authorized to enter into this Agreement on behalf of your organization, and bind your organization/company to this Agreement. If your organization enters into this Agreement on behalf of several users whom are authorized by you or your organization [“Users”], then you confirm that each User is subject to this Agreement, and the organization/company is fully responsible for the acts and omissions of all Users.

1. THE BASIC LICENSE; TERM

The SDK that is licensed to you in accordance with this Agreement is provided “AS-IS”, as further explained in Section 8 below. The license granted to you is a limited, worldwide, royalty-free license that is non-transferable and not assignable outside your organization, and lasts for the duration of your subscription to Preset’s Dashboard. While this cost-free license does not include any warranty, support or maintenance service, and is not subject to any Service Level Agreement [“SLA”] or SLA uptime, credits or other commitments that are features of paid subscriptions, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to update (or not) the SDK from time to time, and to assist you if and when we deem it appropriate. References to the “SDK” in this Agreement shall also include any documentation, user guides, upgrades, updates, supplements, third-party materials and components, Internet-based services and any support provided by, for or on behalf of Preset in connection with use of the SDK. Any Preset terms and conditions that appear in or on, or accompany, any Preset software, items or services also apply and bind Customer in connection with Customer’s use of and access to the SDK.

You (or another User who is your agent or your organization’s employee or agent) have the right to download the SDK from a public repository/package manager hosted by Preset, to install on Customer’s app/device, to support the code snippets that we provide to you to render the Dashboard you have licensed from Preset. The Customer who licensed the Dashboard from Preset has an account with Preset, however the User (if other than you) does not need her or his own User account. The SDK User should be acting to support Customer’s license of the Dashboard in accordance with this Agreement.

2. SCOPE OF USE

Customer’s license of the SDK gives Customer the right to use it in accordance with this Agreement, subject to any limits that apply to the particular license that Customer obtains from Preset, as may be indicated in any Order Form or by notification from Preset. Preset will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with online notice, or notice to the Dashboard customer’s account (if different than Customer), in the event it modifies any technical or numerical aspects of the SDK or makes available new features.

Customer must ensure that each User complies with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, and Customer is fully and directly responsible to Preset for any User acts or omissions in connection with their use of the SDK, whether such User is an employee, contractor or agent of Customer.

3. RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND DISCLOSURE

When Customer accesses or uses the SDK, or any related software or documentation, you agree that you will not copy, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the SDK nor any portion thereof, nor attempt any activities not expressly permitted by this Agreement. Further, Customer understands and agrees that the SDK is the confidential information and property of Preset and its licensors. Accordingly, Customer agrees, and Customer will direct Customer’s Users, not to disclose the SDK nor any confidential information about the SDK, in whole or in part, to any third party without the prior express written consent of Preset in each instance, and subject to Section 5 hereof. In particular, Customer and Customer’s Users will not disclose to any third party or disseminate to the public (except privately to Preset), publish on the internet or elsewhere any tests run on the SDK or results of such tests (if Customer is provided with a beta or evaluation version of the SDK), or any Feedback (as defined below) concerning the SDK or Dashboard without written permission from Preset.

4. OWNERSHIP, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PERSONAL DATA

The SDK and any related materials provided by Preset or obtained or accessed by Customer from Preset or its agents shall remain the sole property of Preset, its licensors and their successors and assigns, and under no circumstances may be used in any way other than pursuant to this Agreement or other agreement between Customer and Preset, nor may the SDK be retained, sold, or reproduced by any means by Customer except as specified in this Agreement or the Preset documentation, and Customer shall have no intellectual property rights, including but not limited to trade secrets, trademarks, patent rights, copyrights and moral rights, in the SDK and related software and documentation [“Intellectual Property Rights”], including upgrades, updates and derivative works thereof. No right or license is granted to Customer or to any third party by implication, estoppel or otherwise, other than the express rights set forth in this Agreement. Preset may discontinue development of the SDK at any time, which will not affect Customer’s use of the SDK or subscription to the Dashboard. Any rights that Customer acquire in SDK, other than the license rights granted by this Agreement, are hereby assigned to Preset, including all Intellectual Property Rights that you may have or acquire therein anywhere in the world (including moral rights, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law), and any other rights you may have pertaining to the SDK provided by or made accessible by Preset. Customer will not attempt to register any Intellectual Property Rights anywhere in the world.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer and Customer’s Users retain all rights in all personal or Customer data [collectively, “Customer Data”] that Customer or its Users may have provided to Preset, and in any personally identifiable information or personal data [“PII”] that Customer and Customer’s Users provide to Preset to facilitate download of the SDK, which PII as between the parties, belongs to Customer, but remains the property of the data subjects who provided such PII. The PII that is provided by the User to access the SDK consists of just an email address. In other words, what Preset brings to the relationship remains the property of Preset and its licensors at all times, and Customer Data and PII that Customer provides Preset (as between Customer and Preset) remains Customer’s property at all times. Feedback becomes Preset’s property as indicated below, as does any derivative work of the SDK or Dashboard technology.

For the avoidance of doubt, Preset is not granted any right, title or interest in and to, and/or the right to use Customer's Intellectual Property Rights, including but not limited to trademarks, trade names, or logotypes for any purposes whatsoever including using Customer's name for marketing or client reference purposes without the prior written consent of Customer.

5. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information includes innovations, any information, knowledge or data of either party which the other party and its employees may access or receive relating to the SDK, its documentation, computer programs, accounting methods, marketing techniques, customer names, negotiated customer fee information, financial information, marketing plans, product plans, product or services roadmaps, business strategies, forecasts, personnel information, customer lists, trade secrets and any other nonpublic technical or business information, whether in writing, given to the recipient orally or in any other way communicated or provided to the recipient, including any Customer Data, documentation, data or information used and/or uploaded by Customer or its Users to the SDK or Dashboard, which the recipient knows or has reason to know that discloser would like to treat as confidential for any purpose, such as maintaining a competitive advantage or avoiding undesirable publicity. The SDK and any related nonpublic documentation shall remain the Confidential Information of Preset at all times. Any nonpublic Customer Data remains the Confidential Information of Customer or Customer’s Users. Neither party as the recipient shall disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, and neither party shall use any Confidential Information of the disclosing party, except that Customer as recipient has the right to properly use the license granted under this Agreement, and Preset as recipient can use Customer’s Confidential Information only to the extent necessary to provide and enhance the SDK and other services, or assist Users (in Preset’s discretion) of the license Customer has obtained under this Agreement.


All Confidential Information of the discloser shall be protected from disclosure by the recipient using the standard of care recipient uses with its most valuable confidential information, and at least a commercially reasonable standard of care; and (ii) no Confidential Information of the discloser shall be used for any purpose other than that for which it has been disclosed, and shall not be used for the benefit of recipient or any third party except as permitted by the license to use the SDK and/or by this Agreement. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is in the public domain through no fault of the recipient; (b) was known to recipient prior to disclosure by the discloser without breach of an obligation to discloser, as can be demonstrated by documentary evidence; (c) was disclosed to recipient by a third party not known by recipient to be under a confidentiality obligation to discloser; (d) was independently developed by recipient without use of Confidential Information of discloser. If required by law or any tribunal or governmental order, recipient can disclose Confidential Information of discloser, but recipient first shall give discloser the opportunity to oppose or limit such disclosure, and shall never disclose more than recipient is required to disclose.


Preset hereby undertakes to ensure that its partners, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives that have access to, or in any way receives Confidential Information under this Agreement, and/or any subcontractors engaged by Preset for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, are bound by confidentiality undertakings no less restrictive than the provisions of this Section 6. This Section 6 shall survive the termination and/or expiration of this Agreement.

6. YOUR FEEDBACK

Customer understands and Customer’s Users agree that Users are welcome to provide Preset with comments, suggestions, concepts, ideas, recommendations for improvements and other feedback concerning the SDK and related materials, such as the Dashboard [collectively, “Feedback”] including without limitation the use, operation, functionality, appearance and other features and characteristics of the SDK and Dashboard. Any and all Feedback concerning the SDK or Dashboard, whether or not patentable or protectable in another form, becomes the exclusive property of Preset immediately upon communication of such Feedback to Preset. Preset may use the Feedback at any time, in any manner, and in any form or medium now existing or hereafter created, and only Preset shall have the right to the registration and/or ownership of any intellectual property rights anywhere in the world in the Feedback or results or derivative works thereof. Accordingly, Customer agrees that such Feedback concerning the SDK or Dashboard is provided only to Preset for its exclusive use in any manner it deems fit, including without limitation the commercial exploitation thereof and/or the sale or other transfer thereof to one or more third parties, free of any Preset obligation to Customer or others. Customer’s Users should not provide to Preset any Feedback in which any third party has or may have any right, claim or interest or in which Customer or Customer’s Users either assert, or have any expectation of retaining, any interest whatsoever or of receiving any remuneration, reward or consideration of any sort, beyond the consideration expressly set forth in this Agreement.
